For each country there are values for every 20% of the population for every year.

Can convert each 20% into a population value per 20% so 5 values per country.

Countries can be classified into continents or regions and grouped together by colour and plotted per region.

Maybe converted into a circle via a button ? and plotted against X and Y axis.
